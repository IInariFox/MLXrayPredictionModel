# Medical Image Classification Using Deep Learning

### Goal: Create a machine learning model to classify medical images and assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential diseases such as pneumonia or diabetic retinopathy. 

### Outcome: Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on publicly available medical datasets, achieving over 90% accuracy. Integrated the model into a Flask-based web app for healthcare providers to upload images and receive predictions in real time.

### Technologies:  Python (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy) OpenCV (for image preprocessing) Flask (for web app integration) Google Colab (for model training) FastAPI (for serving predictions)
