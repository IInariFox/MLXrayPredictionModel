# Medical Image Classification Using Deep Learning

### Goal: Create a machine learning model to classify medical images and assist healthcare professionals in identifying potential diseases such as pneumonia or diabetic retinopathy. 

### Outcome: Trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on publicly available medical datasets, achieving over 90% accuracy. Integrated the model into a Flask-based web app for healthcare providers to upload images and receive predictions in real time.

### Technologies:  Python (TensorFlow, Keras, NumPy) OpenCV (for image preprocessing) Flask (for web app integration) Google Colab (for model training) FastAPI (for serving predictions)

# Conlusion

### The development of the machine learning model for medical image classification, specifically targeting pneumonia detection from chest X-rays, has yielded promising results. By training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on publicly available medical datasets, the model achieved an accuracy of over 90%. This high level of accuracy indicates that the model is proficient in distinguishing between normal chest X-rays and those indicating pneumonia, making it a valuable tool in the healthcare domain.
